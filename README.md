Scale-Inariance
===============

We briefly explore the conjecture that real road networks have the property that the Euclidean distance and road distance has a scale invariant ratio.  That is, no matter how close or far apart the points are, they enjoy the same ratio between the two distances. 
We take various datasets that would be a good approximation of choosing uniformly at random from the population of residential addresses.  Note that it s not enough to sample lat-long, or zipcodes at random since they do not represent the distribution of residential address.
